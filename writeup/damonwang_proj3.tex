\section{Derivatives}

\explain{Knowing that the rings here are circular, how are you
able to assess the correctness of your result?}

Since the rings are circular, the magnitude of the gradient should be radially
symmetric and the plot of $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ should match that of
$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ up to a $90^\circ$ rotation. Just by visual
inspection, my results seem to meet both conditions.

\explain{In the CT foot data, what properties or features are made more visible
by either of these derivative images?}

The gradient visualisation makes edges more visible. Since X-ray opacity roughly
correlates with density, transitions between materials appear as sudden changes
in opacity. Right at the transition, the gradient has large magnitude, so the
foot and then the bones are outlined in white.

\section{Isocontours}

\explain{What heuristic did you use to make sure that you consistently handled
the ambiguous cases?}

I drew lines to keep the positive (above isovalue) corners connected within the
square.

\explain{How are you making sure that the isocontour is drawn in the right
place, and with a constant thickness, even while the image is transformed for
display?}

Instead of specifying the isocontour in index space and letting SVG's
transformation stretch it along one axis, I manually transform the isocontour
into world space using the appropriate $\vec M$. For an image with aspect ratio
$x:y$, $\vec M = [ x, 0 ; 0, y ]$.
