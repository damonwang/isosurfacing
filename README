This is my work for the second project in Gordon Kindlmann's Scientific
Visualisations course (CMSC 23710) at the Univ. of Chicago.

This project has three branches:

* master: what I submitted for my project.

* multiproc: an unsuccessful attempt at improving runtime by parallel execution
  using Python's multiprocessing module.

* interactive: the interesting one, where I am currently trying to make a
  wxPython application that lets the user interactively choose the isovalues
  and see the isocontours immediately
